      <h2>Quick and Extra Easy Pomodoro</h2>
      <p>
        Pasta Pomodoro, don’t you just love saying that? I love saying it and
        eating it. It sounds fancy but it is SO easy. This easy pasta dish is
        one of my all-time favorites. We make this pasta at least twice a month.
        It is a weeknight dinner lifesaver. Pomodoro means tomato in Italian so
        it’s basically pasta with tomato sauce. It is a classic Italian dish
        that is made with simple ingredients…and that is a GOOD thing! Sometimes
        simple is best and that is SO true about this dish.

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          First, make sure you use quality ingredients. There aren’t very many
          ingredients so you want to make sure all of the ingredients are high
          qualit
        </li>
        <li>
          We use canned tomatoes for this recipe, but ONLY San Marzano whole
          peeled tomatoes. They are the BEST canned tomatoes. Make sure you use
          them to get the best flavor for the tomato sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sauce – Whisk together the egg, cheese and pepper in a large bowl. It
          needs to be a large bowl because the pasta will be stirred into the
          sauce in the bowl, off the stove, to avoid scrambling the eggs.
        </li>
        <li>Layer the lasagna according to the recipe instructions.</li>
        <li>
          Puree the tomatoes in a food processor or blender before you get
          started.
        </li>
        <li>
          We use spaghetti, but you can use bucatini, angel hair, or fettuccini.
          We love DeLallo’s pasta!
        </li>
        <li>
          Add a little crushed red pepper flakes to the sauce to give it a
          little kick. If the kids are going to eat it, you can leave them out,
          but our boys are fine with a little heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure you reserve ½ cup of the pasta water so you can add it back
          into the sauce. Don’t miss this step.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add a little butter to the pasta at the end. You only need two
          tablespoons, but those two tablespoons make a big difference. The
          butter adds a richness to the pasta.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don’t be skimpy with the fresh basil and Parmesan cheese. Also, buy
          the GOOD Parmesan cheese for this recipe.
        </li>
